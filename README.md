## Inspiration
Monetization through Social Media platforms like Instagram is very usefull to content creators. But we don't have any proper App to do so. What if users can directly donate/support their favourite posts in Scoail media through Crypto? That's what I have implemented through SocioDapp. 

## What it does
SocioDapp lets users support their favourite Content creators through crypto tipping and offers anyone to post and get support/donations from others. 
    SocioDapp has another feature of Premium where users need to pay some subscription fee to get access to exclusive content. Users who have subscription are logged in automatically as soon as they connect their wallet and those who doesn't have can pay fee right there!

    All of this is possible with power of IPFS. Being a decentralized application it is also very important to protect data and store it in decentralized storage/ distributed network. IPFS gave me the opportunity to fulfill it.


## Challenges we ran into
Entire Dapp is decentralised and should serve wide range of users. I have written different smart contracts to implement different features like supporting, posting, premium content and deployed them in Celo network. Celo gave me the flexibility to choose which currency either Native token or Stable Celo to be set to get donations.

All of this required lot of debugging when connnecting to Celo network. Process is fairly easy and straight forward but the complexity of features in my Dapp resulted in lot of issues while connecting to network and sending, calling transactions using DApp kit from Celo.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am very happy with the way my DApp is powered by IPFS. IPFS is the soul as all the media uploaded is stored and fetched from it.
## What we learned
We have learned about using Celo network and IPFS for flexible storage in decentralized applications.
